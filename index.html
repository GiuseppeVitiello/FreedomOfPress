            Hate Speech, Fake News and Freedom of the Press
        </p>
        <p class="papiello">
            The principle of Freedom of Press, which is part of the broader concept of freedom of expression, states
            that the right to communication and expression through all kinds of media, particularly published materials,
            should be freely exercisable and granted by the state. These concepts are cited in Article 19 of the
            Universal Declaration of Human Rights:
        </p>
        <p class="papiello cit">
            “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions
            without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless
            of frontiers.”
        </p>
        <p class="papiello">
            Each nation must ensure this right, establishing various degrees of freedom regarding scientific research,
            publishing, and press. By only examining freedom of press, particularly the annual report Freedom of the
            Press (published between 1980 and 2017), we can acknowledge that in each of the three categories of freedom
            of press (completely free, partly free, not free) fall about a third of all the nations, with Italy being
            part of the “partly free” category.<br><br>
            The right to information is threatened mostly by fake news, information spread with the intent to mislead
            people. Hate speech, the process which uses any media to inspire hate against an individual or group of
            people, is often used in fake news, as a means to shift blame on the pre-mentioned individual or group. Fake
            news increased a lot in the Information Age, as it’s easier to spread them on websites or social media.
            Issues come to light when we try to solve the problems fake news and hate speech cause: we cannot stop or
            limit their spread without imposing heavy limitations on press itself, and by extension on the freedom of
            opinion and expression. The only way we can counter the spread of fake news, is to spread real and reliable
            information more efficiently and in a more convincing way, while also spreading tips on how to spot fake
            news, e.g. cross-checking the piece of information we got from a source with other sources. This is
            important especially if the primary source are websites and social media, as they are more prone to contain
            false information.
        </p>
        <p class="papiello cit">
            “Reporters Without Borders (French: Reporters sans frontières (RSF)) is an international non-profit and
            non-governmental organization with the stated aim of safeguarding the right to freedom of information.”
        </p>
        <p class="papiello">
            It played a vital role in this research, particularly with its World Press Freedom Index, with which 180
            countries are ranked according to the level of freedom available to journalists and media in general.

            Hate speech is the active use of printed materials or any other means aimed at conveying hate and encouraging
            violence against an individual or a group of people, solely based on their gender, race, religion, sexual
            orientation, etc.<br><br>
            Hate speech has been present throughout all of history, dating back to the first civilizations. Although in
            Ancient Greece there are examples of politicians creating false information to damage their opponent’s
            reputation, the first case of hate speech to date is related to the Roman Empire: In 64 AD, Emperor Nero blamed
            Christians for starting the Great Fire of Rome, and justified a series of persecutions against them. Later, hate
            speech was used as a means to justify wars, and generally give people a reason to fight against an opponent. In
            the latest centuries we have examples of hate speech which are not linked to war, but are embedded in people’s
            minds as prejudices on certain groups of people.<br>
            Black people have always had to face these problems. Since they claimed the same rights as white people, hate
            speech has been used to invalidate any form of success a black person could have, to justify hate crimes against
            them, and to negate their rights. Jews, homosexuals, and political opposers have notoriously been victims of
            hate
            speech before they were deported and killed by people following Nazist, Fascist, or Socialist ideals during and
            after World War II. To this day, homosexuals, transgender people, and in general whoever has a different sexual
            orientation or gender are victims of hate speech, with people stating they are perverted, they are not normal,
            etc.
            Of course, hate speech is more effective on minorities, because they are already facing social problems, but
            everyone
            can be subject and overwhelmed by it. We can, for example, cite thousands of bullism and cyber-bullism cases,
            which don’t
            necessarily result in physical violence but still cause the victim’s mental health to decline and in some cases,
            leads them to commit suicide.<br><br>
            The Internet has progressively made spreading hate speech easier, because by hiding their identities online,
            haters can express their hateful and polarizing opinions out loud without risking being arrested, eliminating
            the need to face their actions’ consequences. Even if the biggest social media have implemented ways to limit
            hate speech (by censoring offensive words and actively reviewing flagged content), there are others social media
            on which hatred can be easily conveyed.<br><br>
            Several scholars and activists have criticized the so-called “hate speech theory”: they argue that the efforts
            done to censor hate speech may be disadvantageous to the minorities that censorship tries to protect. Censoring
            hate speech, without considering the context, assumes bad faith on the part of people regardless of their stated
            intentions, and eliminates the ethical responsibility of the individual. Studies made on this subject have shown
            that hate speech can indeed have positive effects, offering opportunities to change people’s minds, helping to
            identify individuals to be avoided in certain situations, and providing information about the current state of
            society.<br>

            The term “Fake News” refers to all kinds of false information, but it is often used to indicate false news
            spread with malicious intent, which can be to damage the reputation of a person or entity, to manipulate the
            public perception of certain events, or to make money through advertising revenue. However, said term is too
            vague, having even been used by high-profile politicians and public figures to lower the credibility of sources
            criticizing them. Because of this, many scholars, newspapers and public institutions (most remarkably the British
            government since 2018) have stopped using this term and refer to the issue as “information pollution”.<br> 
            Three types of information content problems can be distinguished:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mis-information: false information disseminated without harmful intent.</li>
            <li>Dis-information: created and shared by people with harmful intent.</li>
            <li>Mal-information: the sharing of "genuine" information with the intent to cause harm.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="papiello">
            Though once common in printed form, with the rise of social media the spread of fake news skyrocketed,
            particularly on Facebook. The algorithms that control the social media feeds have been implicated in the spread
            of fake news, together with political polarization, post-truth politics and confirmation bias. The possibility
            of using anonymously-hosted websites to spread fake news has made it difficult for authorities to prosecute the
            perpetrators, which in some cases were supported by hostile foreign actors trying to manipulate election
            results, like in 2016 United States’ presidential elections.<br>
            Many organisations are working to limit the spread of false information, fact-checking news. Since 2015 the
            International Fact-Checking Network has supported international collaborative fact-checking efforts, providing
            training and publishing a code of principles. Another vital strategy to limit this issue is teaching the public
            how to ascertain falsehood from truthful news. To this aim the International Federation of Library Associations
            and Institutions published a diagram summarizing the main points in order to spot fake news, which are:<br>
        </p>
        <ul>    
            <li>Consider the source (to understand its mission and purpose)</li>
            <li>Read beyond the headline (to understand the whole story)</li>
            <li>Check the authors (to see if they are real and credible)</li>
            <li>Assess the supporting sources (to ensure they support the claims)</li>
            <li>Check the date of publication (to see if the story is relevant and up to date)</li>
            <li>Ask if it is a joke (to determine if it is meant to be satire)</li>
            <li>Review your own biases (to see if they are affecting your judgment)</li>
            <li>Ask experts (to get confirmation from independent people with knowledge).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="papiello">
            Countering fake news has been, and still is, the subject of extensive research, which has brought to light many
            possible ways to go forward, most notably it has become clear that one active approach to diminish the effects
            of fake news is to flood the information space and social media feed with accurate and genuine information, as
            to drown fake news. Another potential strategy is that of inoculation theory, which works in a similar fashion
            as vaccines: through pre-exposure to a weakened version of the stronger, future threat, it can have the ability
            to build a resilience against misinformation and fake news in the individual.
