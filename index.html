                The principle of Freedom of Press, which is part of the broader concept of freedom of expression, states
                that the right to communication and expression through all kinds of media, particularly published
                materials, should be freely exercisable and granted by the state. These concepts are cited in Article 19
                of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
                “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes
                freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart 
                information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Each nation must ensure this right, establishing various degrees of freedom regarding scientific
                research, publishing, and press. By only examining freedom of press, particularly the annual report 
                Freedom of the Press (published between 1980 and 2017), we can acknowledge that in each of the three 
                categories of freedom of press (completely free, partly free, not free) fall about a third of all 
                the nations, with Italy being part of the “partly free” category.
                <br><br>
                The right to information is threatened mostly by fake news, information spread with the intent to
                mislead people. Hate speech, the process which uses any media to inspire hate against an individual 
                or group of people, is often used in fake news, as a means to shift blame on the pre-mentioned 
                individual or group. Fake news increased a lot in the Information Age, as it’s easier to spread them 
                on websites or social media. Issues come to light when we try to solve the problems fake news and hate 
                speech cause: we cannot stop or limit their spread without imposing heavy limitations on press itself, 
                and by extension on the freedom of opinion and expression. The only way we can counter the spread of 
                fake news, is to spread real and reliable information more efficiently and in a more convincing way, 
                while also spreading tips on how to spot fake news, e.g. cross-checking the piece of information we 
                got from a source with other sources. This is important especially if the primary source are websites
                and social media, as they are more prone to contain false information.

                “Reporters Without Borders (French: Reporters sans frontières (RSF)) is an
                international non-profit and non-governmental organization with the stated 
                aim of safeguarding the right to freedom of information.”

                It played a vital role in this research, particularly with its World Press Freedom Index, with which 180
                countries are ranked according to the level of freedom available to journalists and media in general.
