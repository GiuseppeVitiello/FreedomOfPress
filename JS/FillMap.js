However, the same article forbids shows, printed publications, and all other displays which are contrary to morality, and this is a huge problem. Morality is in constant change, and is personal to everyone, making this comma very dubious and hard to use.<br><br>The article, in the end, only guarantees the freedom of press, but limits one’s freedom of expression.
